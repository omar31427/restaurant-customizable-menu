## Description
this is a user friendly site for restaurants, the admin of the site can access specific pages such as menu editor, in
menu-editor the admin can write the name of the menu to edit that menu, or he can add items to the menu, lets say the 
menu is main courses , the menuItem would be steak for example, then the user would be able to fill out ingredients for 
the menuItem and check if they are vegan or not.
the index page or the home page can be accessed by anyone to view the menu and their corresponding menuItems, or they
can search for a menuItem by name, or by ingredients, they can specify search results to be vegan or vegetarian
to be able to finalize a purchase through the site the user needs to have an account, the reason for this is that the 
actual business that is going to make use of this website does not make individual requests and exclusively attends to
events and big orders, usually the orders are the same , so i thought it would be a good idea if the user can add items 
to cart in order to purchase them at different times of the week
### General information
a restaurant site that has user interface and admin interface and a non authenticated visitor interface
### Functionality
the admin is able to manually add menuItems on their own without the help of a programmer, the user are able to quickly
search for their favourite meal quickly and with ease.
the user is supposed to be able to see their own purchase history , and the admin is supposed to be able to view the 
entire purchase history for everyone, i have created a table for such inqueries and it works just fine i just wasnt able
to connect the frontend properly in time
